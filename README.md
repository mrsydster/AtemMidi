# A few experiments with MIDI and Arturia's MiniLab mkII

This repository contains some integration experiments made with the [easymidi](https://github.com/dinchak/node-easymidi) and [win-audio](https://github.com/fcannizzaro/win-audio), with the purpose of giving the MiniLab other uses, like controlling system audio, etc.

There's also the option of controlling stuff like the pads colors, so we can render things like current volume, etc.
